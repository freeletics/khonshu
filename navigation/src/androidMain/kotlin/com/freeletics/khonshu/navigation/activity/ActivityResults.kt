             * - Android 11+: the user dismissed the notification request without making a choice
             *     - `shouldShowRationale` is `false` if the user did not deny the permission before
             *     - `shouldShowRationale` is `true` if the user denied the permission before
             *
             * Until Android 11 `shouldShowRationale` being `false` can be interpreted as the permission
             * being denied forever. However on Android 11+ there is the edge case the user can dismiss
             * the prompt without making a choice.
