# Modern Android Development - The Freeletics Way

At Freeletics we use many of the Jetpack/AndroidX libraries but not always in the way
they are advertised and recommended in Google's tutorials.
This project showcases our own flavored version of Modern Android Development
as well as some of our own utilities.


## Navigator

The navigator library is a wrapper around AndroidX navigation that allows to separate navigation
logic from the UI layer and provides a scalable approach to type safe navigation in a highly
modularized code base.

For more information check out the [docs][4].


## Whetstone

Whetstone is a plugin for [Anvil][5] that helps with
generating dependency injection related code and common boilerplate for feature screens.

For more information check out the [docs][6].


## Helpers

Small libraries that provide utility functionality or a base for other libraries to build upon.

For more information check out the [docs][7].
