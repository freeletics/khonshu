/**
 * Add this annotation to a [androidx.compose.runtime.Composable] function. It is required that
 * the annotated function has `State` as first parameter and `(Action) -> Unit` as second parameter,
 * where `State` and `Action` match the given `StateMachine`.
 *
 * This will trigger the generation of
 * - a wrapper Composable that sets up the annotated Composable with the given [stateMachine]
 * - a Dagger subcomponent that uses [scope] as scope marker and [parentScope] as `parentScope`
 *
 * The generated Composable will have the same name as the annotated one with `Whetstone` as prefix
 * and takes a `Bundle` of arguments as its sole parameter.
