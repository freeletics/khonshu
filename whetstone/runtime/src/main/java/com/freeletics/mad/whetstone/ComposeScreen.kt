/**
 * By adding this annotation to a [androidx.compose.runtime.Composable] function, another
 * Composable is generated that will have the same name with `Screen` as suffix. The generated
 * function has [androidx.navigation.NavController] as it's sole parameter. It will internally
 * call the annotated composable. It is required that the annotated function has `State` as first
 * parameter and `(Action) -> Unit` as second parameter, where `State` and `Action` match the given
 * `StateMachine`.
 *
 * **StateMachine**
 *
 * The [stateMachine] will be collected while the composition is active and the emitted state will
 * be passed to the annotated [androidx.compose.runtime.Composable] function. Any invocation of the
 * `(Action) -> Unit` parameter will be dispatched to the `StateMachine`
 *
 * It is recommended to annotate the given `StateMachine` class with a Dagger scope like
 * explained below.
 *
 * **Navigation**
 *
 * If the 2 optional `navigator` and `navigationHandler` are set the generated composable will use
 * these together with the passed in `NavController` to set up navigation while the composition
 * is active.
 *
 * **Scopes, Dagger and Anvil**
 *
 * There will also be a generated Dagger component that is tied to the composable function but
 * survives configuration changes and stays alive while the composable destination is on the
 * backstack.
 *
 * The generated component uses [ScopeTo] as it's scope where the [ScopeTo.marker]
 * parameter is the specified [scope] class. This scope can be used to scope classes
 * in the component an tie them to to component's life time. The annotated class is also used as
 * [com.squareup.anvil.annotations.MergeComponent.scope], so it can be used to contribute modules
 * and bindings to the generated component.
 *
 * E.g. for `@ComposeScreen(scope = CoachScreen::class, ...)` the scope of the generated
 * component will be `@ScopeTo(CoachScreen::class)`, modules can be contributed with
 * `@ContributesTo(CoachScreen::class)` and bindings with
 * `@ContributesBinding(CoachScreen::class, ...)`.
 *
 * By default the following classes are available for injection in the component:
 * - everything accessible through the provided [dependencies] interface
 * - a [androidx.lifecycle.SavedStateHandle]
 * - a [android.os.Bundle] obtained from [androidx.navigation.NavController.currentBackStackEntry]
 * - if [coroutinesEnabled] is `true`, a [kotlinx.coroutines.CoroutineScope] that will be cancelled automatically
 * - if [rxJavaEnabled] is `true`, a [io.reactivex.disposables.CompositeDisposable] that will be cleared automatically
 *
 * The mentioned [dependencies] interface will be looked up by calling
 * [android.content.Context.getSystemService] on either the [android.app.Activity] context or the
 * [android.app.Application] context. The parameter passed to `getSystemService` is the fully
 * qualified name of [parentScope]. It is recommended to use the same marker class that is used as
 * Anvil scope for the [parentScope].
 *
 * **Example**
 *
 * This example code:
 * ```
 * @ComposeScreen(...)
 * fun Coach(state: CoachState, actions: (CoachAction) -> Unit)
 * ```
 *
 * Generates the following composable:
 * ```
 * @Composable
 * fun CoachScreen(navController: NavController) {
 *   // setup code omitted
 *   val state by stateMachine.asState()
 *   Coach(state.value) { action ->
 *     scope.launch { stateMachine.dispatch(action) }
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
